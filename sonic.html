<p>Sonic use to be a rabbit
Sega was bent on creating a character that would rival the appeal of Nintendo’s Mario. Early drafts of the brand’s 
hero envisioned him as a rabbit that could grasp things and fight with prehensile ears.his name wasn't always"sonic."
Even after Sega settled on the hedgehog, an idea proposed by designer Naoto Ohshima, the company tried out
 a taxonomically confusing name for the character: Mr. Needlemouse. <p>
<p>Sonic's archenemy went by many different names.
As you may know, Sonic’s primary nemesis Dr. Ivo Robotnik was originally known as Dr. Eggman in Japan; Sega’s U.S.
 and Japanese headquarters could not agree on a universal moniker.
 American developer Dean Sitton came up with the Robotnik name for Sonic’s central villain.Sonic was in wreck-it-Ralph<p>
